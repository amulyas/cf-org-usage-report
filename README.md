#Report on memory usage of Cloud Foundry Orgs

This is a sample script to report on the amount of memory used against the currently applied quota. It uses CF curl and the currently logged in user to access the [Cloud Controller rest API](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/). This script is written against v196 but is expected to work against any release. Should you have a problem please open an issue.
